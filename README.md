Portfolio module for Moodle, heavily based on the Book module for Moodle (http://moodle.org/) - Copyright (C) 2004-2011  Petr Skoda (http://skodak.org/)

Based on the book module, this activity allows students to create portfolio contributions, with a structure set by the teacher.
The course teacher(s) are able to create an overall structure for the students' work via a series of chapters and subchapters, the same as the layout found in the book module.
The course students are then able to add their own contributions based on this structure, which can then be commented on an graded by the course teacher(s).

Intentionally omitted features:

* more chapter levels - it would encourage teachers to write too much complex and long books, better use standard standalone HTML editor and import it as Resource. DocBook format is another suitable solution.
* TOC hiding in normal view - instead use printer friendly view
* PDF export - there is no elegant way AFAIK to convert HTML to PDF, use virtual PDF printer or better use DocBook format for authoring
* detailed student tracking (postponed till officially supported)
* export as zipped set of HTML pages - instead use browser command Save page as... in print view

Future:

* No more development planned
